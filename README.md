# Notes
All I need is NAME, COST, NOW columns in csv.
Everything else can be looked up/derived.

My google sheet structure should be 
NAME, COST, NEXT, PRICE, NOW

NEXT and PRICE get ignored when parsing and should be overwritten when pasting
This means when I paste, I should be pasting the whole thing from top left corner

# Dev Dependencies

```
brew install jq
```
